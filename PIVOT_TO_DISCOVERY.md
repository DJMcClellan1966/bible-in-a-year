# Pivot to Discovery Mode - Removing Reading Plan Pressure

## Philosophy Change

**From:** "Bible in a Year" - Daily reading plan with progress tracking  
**To:** "Bible Discovery" - Deep exploration when you have time

### Why This Change?

Many people struggle with:
- Reading plans that feel like obligations
- Getting "behind" and giving up
- Surface-level reading that doesn't engage
- Missing the deeper meanings

**What works:**
- Deep dives when you're interested
- No pressure to keep up
- Focus on meaning discovery
- Available when you need spiritual connection
